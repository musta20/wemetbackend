<p>wemet was created to provide a platform where people could connect with 
    other people of diverse backgrounds and experiences that may differ from their own.
     wemet’s Community Guidelines are intended to further that goal by providing general guidance and explaining what is and isn’t allowed on wemet. They are not intended to comprehensively identify every type of inappropriate or unlawful conduct or content. Users should be guided by common sense and an expectation that they should treat their fellow users with respect.</p>
<p>These Community Guidelines apply to your access to and use of the wemet website and any services offered by wemet (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). wemet reserves the right to revise these Community Guidelines at any time for any reason and updates will be posted to the Services. These Community Guidelines are in addition to the wemet <a href="/static/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, which also apply to your access to and use of the Services.</p>
<p>wemet reserves the right to ban (temporarily or permanently) or take other appropriate action with or without notice with respect to any user that engages in conduct that wemet determines, in its sole discretion, to be inappropriate or harmful, whether or not such conduct is identified below.</p>
<p>If you encounter conduct or content on the Services that you believe violate any of the guidelines below or if you have other safety concerns about the Services, please contact wemet at <a href="mailto:safety@wemet.live">safety@wemet.live</a> and include “wemet-Safety” in the subject line.

There are a number of websites that provide information about such parental control protections, including but not limited to <a href="https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/">https://www.connectsafely.org/controls/</a>.</p>
